# crowd_funding_dApp
Project Initiation:
- Users can initiate new crowdfunding projects for various purposes, such as business ventures, creative endeavors, or charitable causes.
- Each project initiator specifies project details, including a title, description, and target amount to be raised.

Target Amount Setting:
- During project initiation, the project owner sets the target amount of funds needed for their project. This target represents the goal that must be achieved through contributions from users.

Minimum Contribution Amount:
- The dApp allows project owners to set a minimum contribution amount that users must provide when they wish to contribute to the project.
- This ensures that each contribution has a meaningful impact toward achieving the project's target.

Pot Account for Funding:
- Each project owner establishes a designated "pot account" where users can contribute funds.
- This pot account acts as a centralized repository for all incoming contributions.

User Donations:
- Individuals interested in supporting the project can donate funds to the pot account.
- The dApp provides a user-friendly and secure interface for making contributions, possibly using cryptocurrencies.

Pre-Closure Option:
- Project owners have the authority to pre-close their project before reaching the target amount.
- This could occur if the project's funding needs change or if the owner decides to conclude the fundraising phase early.

Target Amount Achievement:
- As users continue to donate funds, the dApp tracks the accumulated contributions.
- When the total contributions reach or surpass the target amount, the conditions for project success are met.

Fund Disbursement to Owner:
- Upon reaching the target amount, the dApp automatically initiates the transfer of the accumulated funds from the pot account to the project owner's designated account.
- This ensures a seamless process for delivering the funds to the owner.

Decentralization and Transparency:
- The dApp's architecture leverages blockchain technology for decentralization.
- Smart contracts or runtime modules on the blockchain ensure transparency, trust, and automated fund management.
